# Contributing

Contributing is very easy. We use GitHub for our online repository, and issue tracker, so an account first.

### Repository set up
1. Fork [free-pixel](https://github.com/carlosm00/free-pixel/) so you have a personal repository to push to.
2. Clone your personal repository with the command provided through the `Clone` button on GitHub.
3. Create a new branch named after the specific change suggested. We advise using a name like 'feature/adding-cows', where `adding cows` is to be changed with your specific change.

### Making changes
To make a contribution you will need to make a feature branch. This greatly simplifies adding your code to the official repository, and it ensures the master branch is always working.
We advise to let us know what you're working on by commenting on or creating an [issue](https://github.com/carlosm00/free-pixel/issues). 
This way we make sure we all work on different things.

Please, avoid destructive changes unless strictly necessary.

Please, provide meaningfull commit messages.

Please, provide usefull names to all files.

All changes must go through a Pull Request, that is later to be approved before merge.
