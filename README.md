# free-pixel
Set of pixel art assets to be used, changed and improved by whoever needs it.

## About assets
As for today, all assets were done with [LibreSprite](https://github.com/LibreSprite/LibreSprite), and are sized 32x32. 
Assets are organized on folders by each general category. 
Each folder contains the sprite project (suffixed with the ~.ase extension), from which at least one exported PNG file with the same name is generated. 
In some cases, one sprite project leads to producing many PNG assets, mainly due to variations on colour.

All sprite projects can be cloned, and adjusted to meet the user needs. In most cases, to ease its usage, the sprite project is divided into several layers.
